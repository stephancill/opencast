# Opencast

A fully open source Twitter flavoured Farcaster client. Originally a fork of [ccrsxx/twitter-clone](https://github.com/ccrsxx/twitter-clone).

The goal of this project is to provide a reference implementation of a Farcaster client in order to make it easier for developers to explore their ideas without having to start from scratch.

It only depends on the reference Farcaster postgres indexer and optionally a hub for submitting messages.
